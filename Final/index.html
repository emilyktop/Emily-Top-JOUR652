<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
  <p> Concussions have become a big discussion in sports. More often than not, the sport that comes up when talking about concussions is football and the National Football League. However, other sports are similarly physical resulting in concussions. One sport that is often overlooked when discussing concussions and concussion protocol is the National Hockey League.</p>

<h2 id="basic">What is a concussion and how is it diagnosed?</h2>
  <p> According to the Center of Disease Control, a concussion is “a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head.” Any force that causes the brain to move within the head quickly back and forth can also cause concussions. </p>

  </figure>

  <p>The CDC states that symptoms of concussions can affect thoughts and memories, physical attributes, emotions and mood, and sleep. People that suffer from concussions typically have difficulty remembering recent events, headaches, difficulty with bright light, irritability, and changes in sleep behavior.</p>

  <p> Medical professionals often utilize the Sports Concussions Assessment Tool for athletes over 13. <a href=https://www.abiireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/B22546-Sports-Physician-Concussion-Assessment-Tool-SCAT3.pdf>SCAT3</a> is “a standardized tool for evaluating injured athletes for concussion and can be used in athletes aged from 13 years and older,” according to Acquired Brain Injury Ireland. SCAT3 assesses an injured patient in the following categories: Glasgow Comma Scale, Maddocks Score, Symptom Evaluation, Cognitive Assessment, Neck Examination, Balance Examination, Coordination Examination, Standardized Assessment of Concussion Delayed Recall. </p>

  <p> Physicians can also evaluate the damage using a CT scan of the brain. However, according to UPMC Sports Medicine, 50 percent of concussions go unreported or undetected. </p>

<h2 id="data">The Data</h2>
  <p>In general, injuries in hockey increased annually by 1.3 percent from 1988 to 2004. As seen below, The number of concussions per year peaked during the time period in the season 2000-2001. For concussions, in a study completed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1941284/">Agel, Thomas, Dick and Marshall</a> in 2007, they were the 2nd most common injury in hockey games behind knee injuries and made up 9 percent of in-game injuries during the time period (in the NCAA, which is being used as a proxy for the NHL).</p>

<br>

<p>Certain positions in hockey are also more likely to get concussions. Below shows that forwards are most likely to get a concussion, and goalies are least likely to get a concussion. Forwards represent 50 percent of the players on the ice but have a higher percentage of concussions comparatively.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal Accounts </h2>
  <p>In the past few years, former National Hockey League players, and other professional players, have come out reporting their experiences with concussions. One of the first to do so was Bryce Salvador, a former defenseman for the St. Louis Blues and New Jersey Devils, in an autobiographical account on The Player’s Tribune. After getting hit in the face with a puck, Salvador explained, “My ears didn’t stop ringing for months, but I finished the rest of the 2009-2010 season.”</p>

  <blockquote>"You can take my name off the Stanley Cup twice over. I can’t live like [this] anymore." - Daniel Carcillo, Retired NHL Player</blockquote>

  <p>Nick Boynton of the Philadelphia Flyers, a known fighter in the league, said, “I started blacking out after I took a big hit to the head.” His concussion symptoms even led to issues with mental illness. He described his experience, “Whenever things get really bad, and I find myself thinking about death, it’s always in the context of release. Escaping the pain…And even though I definitely wouldn’t say death has been something that I’ve wanted — that I actually wanted to die — at the same time, when I’d hit those low points, it was like ... I didn’t exactly not want it, either.”</p>

  <p>Boynton continued, "They can scratch my name off, and I’d hand my ring back in right now if I could go back and make it so that I wouldn’t have had to experience all this pain and sorrow and anger and sadness.”</p>

  <p> On The Player's Tribune, former player Daniel Carcillo posted a video of his experiences with concussions after leaving the NHL:</p>

<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
  <p>Although most concussions will heal themselves by resting and avoiding physically demanding activities, according to the CDC, this protocol does not help all cases, especially players affected by multiple concussions. Also, there is no FDA-approved treatment for acute concussions, according to <a href="https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/fulltext/2017/09000/Concussion_in_Ice_Hockey___Current_Gaps_and_Future.14.aspx">Smith, et al. </a> in 2017.</p>

  <p> For Adam Estoclet who played in the Swedish Allsvenskan League, his symptoms were fine for seven games, but afterward, he wrote, “The only issue is, they didn’t know what was going on in my head. My headaches were gradually coming back, and by the end of the eighth game, I could only hold my head in my hands.”</p>

<blockquote>"Nobody could tell me how to fix it... Nobody can see what’s going on in your brain. There’s no test. I got MRIs, CT Scans, X-rays — nothing showed up." - Adam Estoclet, Professional Hockey Player</blockquote>

  <p>Boynton and Salvador also expressed difficulties with current treatment. When they saw no results, each player reached out to other doctors that were trying out new treatment types. Estoclet and Salvador both mentioned how their new treatment was a way to restart their brain systems. </p>

  <p>Estoclet said, “And [Dr. Kutcher] promised that he could fix me. Not through rest. But through slowly rehabilitating my brain — by building its systems back up from scratch.”</p>

  <p> Salvador described his treatment: “Kids exercise this muscle [the vestibular system] all the time by jumping around, doing tumbles, spinning, and just generally being kids. So in order to re-calibrate my system and build up my muscle, I had to embrace my inner child.”</p>

  <p>Below is one example of the some new treatments that players are undergoing:</p>

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
  <p>While these players have been lucky enough to work through new treatments, not all NHL players that had been greatly affected by concussions were able to. Some players have committed suicide while others died of other causers and later were found to have had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, more commonly known as CTE, which can only be diagnosed post-mortem.</p>

</div><!--End Timeline Div-->

<h2 id="future">Moving Forward</h2>
  <p>The NHL has taken action and has made some changes to the rules in an attempt to reduce the incidences of concussions. In 2016, the NHL updated its concussion protocol. "A new staff of Central League Spotters will monitor all games from the Player Safety Room in New York and will be authorized to require a Player's removal from play for evaluation for concussion if the Player exhibits certain visible sign(s) under the Protocol, following a direct or indirect blow to the head," according to an <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-updates-concussion-protocol/c-282571624">NHL press release</a>. The Central League Spotters will also be complemented by In-Arena League Spotters and On-Ice Officials. Clubs that violate the new concussion protocol will be sanctioned by the League. For example, not removing a player that needs concussion evaluation.</p>

  <p> Additionally, players found to have targeted another player's head is often fined by the League after the game. If the hit is really bad, the player may receive a suspension, such as the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/video/wilson-suspended-20-games/t-277440360/c-61556003">suspension</a> handed to Tom Wilson of the Washington Capitals early in the 2018-2019 season. 

  <p>While the League is working to reduce the problem, a few rule changes do not change the aggressive nature of the sport. Hits still occur; players are still run into the boards; concussions will happen. Without eliminating the sport as a whole, teams could change their diagnostic procedure.</p>

  <p>As aforementioned, 50 percent of concussions go unreported. New procedures have been studied that could change the face of concussion diagnosis. In <a href="https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/fulltext/2017/09000/Concussion_in_Ice_Hockey___Current_Gaps_and_Future.14.aspx">Smith, et al.</a>, the following procedures were discussed: Quantified Electroencephalogram evaluation, the King-Devick Test, and assessing neurobiomarkers.</p>

          <h5>Quantified Electroencephalogram Evaluation (qEEG)</h5>
                <p>"Quantitative electroencephalography adds modern computer and statistical analyses to traditional EEG recordings and requires additional lead placements," according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/quantitative-electroencephalography">David G. Greer and Peter D. Donofrio</a> in Clinical Neurotoxicology, 2009. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/155005940403500410">Jacques Duff</a>, in 2004, found that qEEG was 96% successful in diagnosing post-concussion syndrome. "The QEEG can provide clinicians with better, more targeted treatment options byproviding functional information onthe underlying neurophysiology associated with symptoms of post-concussion syndrome," Duff found in his Meta-analysis.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h5>King-Devick Test</h5>
                    <p>"The King-Devick Test is a two-minute rapid number naming assessment in which an in individual quickly reads aloud single digit numbers and evaluates impairments of eye movements, attention and language function," according to the official <a href="https://kingdevicktest.com/products/concussion/sideline-concussion-screening/">King-Devick Test website</a>. Peer-reviewed studies have shown that this test is an objective and fast measure indicating a potential concussion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h5>Neurobiomarkers</h5>
                    <p>"A biomarker is a characteristic that can be objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of a physiological as well as a pathological process or pharmacological response to a therapeutic intervention," according to <a href="http://www.medlink.com/article/biomarkers_in_neurology">MedLink Neurology</a>. In other words, a biomarker will show a bodily change to a intervention. A biomarker could be something as simple as  a change in blood pressure, or it could be more complex and be an analysis of blood proteins. A new lab <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X17724681">study</a> out of the University of California, Los Angeles, found new blood sample biomarkers which can indicate if brain tissue cells have been tramuatized. The biomarkers can be found within an hour and could be detected from minor injuries that could not be found via CAT scan.  </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p> Concussions in sports are a hot topic as we've come to discover the long-term consequences of even only a few concussions in one's lifetime. Although football is the sport that is most discussed and linked with concussion, other sports, such as hockey, have just as many issues that need addressing.</p>

<p> Banning the sports entirely does not seem like the best approach, especially as technology is improving, but changes must be made. The current diagnosis and treatment plans for concussions are not enough. </p>

<blockquote>"I want to pass on the lessons of perseverance, sacrifice, and determination that I was fortunate enough to have learned while playing hockey. If I believe in one thing in life, it’s that hockey is a force for good." - Bryce Salvador, Retired NHL Player</blockquote>

<p>Teams at all levels must look to improve their protocols to better diagnosis and report concussions as well as update their treatment protocol to more than just rest. As the personal stories from the NHL players have shown, rest is not always enough. Medical practitioners need to become more creative to better treat the short-term and long-term symptoms and problems associated with concussions. </p>

<p> Hockey, and other sports, can still be positive influences in society, but we must look to and utilize these new revolutionary tools and treatments.</p>
